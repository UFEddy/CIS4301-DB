                <p>The query involved will determine the cost per win for each player by comparing their salary to their WAR. 
                    This analysis will be repeated over multiple seasons to identify trends in how much the industry is 
                    willing to pay for wins. The query will also reveal changes in the cost per WAR which will allow us 
                    to see whether teams are investing efficiently in player performance over the years.
