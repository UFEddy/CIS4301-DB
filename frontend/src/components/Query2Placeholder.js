                <p>evaluating the difference in player performance when they play at home vs when they play on the road. 
                    This will have a timeline of only 1 season as a season has sufficient enough data points (81 games each for a full season) 
                    to draw significant enough conclusions from. The screen will have an option for the user to select a year, search for a player, 
                    and choose the evaluating metric. The results are then displayed for both in a graph.
